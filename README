In Laravel when uploading files sometime getClientOriginalExtension() returns empty string .
Here is below explanation of  problem and solution for it.

The getClientOriginalExtension() method returns the original file extension.
It is extracted from the original file name that was uploaded. Then it should not be considered as a safe    value.

Input::file('File')->getClientOriginalExtension();<br>
We should use guessExtension() method for resolution.

The guessExtension() method returns the extension based on the mime type.

This method uses the mime type as guessed by getMimeType() to guess the file extension.

Input::file('File')->guessExtension();<br>
